# Third-Party APIs: Task Board Application

## Description

Created a task board application that helps to manage diffeerent tasks, quite similar to the function of your marked Carlendars. But this app goes beyond simple calendar reminders as it triggers a warning when the deadline is very close e.g by 1 or 2 days. It displays a yellow colour if the task is so close to the dealine, and displays a green colour if task-delivery date is still ahead by 3-4days. A task that is past delivery date will display red.


### Deployment
In building this app, I deployed a combination of:

1.Html
2.Css
3.Javascript 
4.Json
5.Jquery &
6.Bootstrap

The combination of these technologies also enables you to move each task card to the two columns as deemed fit.

## Usage
1.Create a task, choose a disticnt name for the task as suitable
2.Select the task's delivery date which must be a future date
3.Each task created displays a particular colour according to the deadline dates
4. The task card displays yellow, if the delivery date is so close e.g 1day
5. The task card displays green, if the delivery date is not so close e.g 3 or more days from creation date.
6. Each task has a delete button, in case it is cancelled or not required
7. Tasks past delivery date displays red
